      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/000000-14213d-fca311-e5e5e5-ffffff" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/000000-14213d-fca311-e5e5e5-ffffff</a>

        Typography
      </h3>

      <h4>
        Heading Font: 'Yeseva One', cursive
      </h4>
      <p>
        This makes the headlines be more cool! Plus, it doesn't have a great effect so that doesn't affect the reader's desire to read.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: 'Jaldi', sans-serif
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font helps the paragraphs be more readable so that readers can continue reading throughout the website.  <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Term Website Project is designed to be a comprehensive assessment of all the course outcomes. You will be given site specifications as if you were contracted to plan, design, and build a prototype website for an organization. In addition, developmental specifications will be given to ensure proper assessment of the application of course content, skills, and technologies in conjunction with the course outcomes.      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        The content is fictitious, but the site should be complete without any placeholders or nonsense/filler language. This may require a little creativity as you contemplate the purpose of the site and the target audience in your planning. The final project requires you to create a working site containing relevant and reasonable information.
