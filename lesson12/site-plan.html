        The Term Website Project is designed to be a comprehensive assessment of all the course outcomes. You will be given site specifications as if you were contracted to plan, design, and build a prototype website for an organization. In addition, developmental specifications will be given to ensure proper assessment of the application of course content, skills, and technologies in conjunction with the course outcomes.      </p>

        The content is fictitious, but the site should be complete without any placeholders or nonsense/filler language. This may require a little creativity as you contemplate the purpose of the site and the target audience in your planning. The final project requires you to create a working site containing relevant and reasonable information.
