        <h2>Possible Sites to Visit</h2>
        <h3>Palancar Reef</h3>
        <p>Thanks to conservation efforts, marine life in the waters around Cozumel has bounced 
            back after decades of overfishing. Nowadays, the onus is on observing fish in their 
            natural habitat rather than catching them. The island is now extremely popular as a 
            destination for snorkelers and scuba divers, who are spoilt for choice when it comes 
            to choosing which lovely reef to explore.</p>
        <p>One of the best spots to dive is the Palancar Reef, rising from depths of up to 80 
            meters to shallows just beneath the surface of the sea at the southwest end of the 
            island. A popular dive includes a large bronze figure of Christ placed some 17 
            meters underwater. Other good diving locales are on the San Francisco, Paraíso, 
            Columbia, and Maracaibo reefs, as well as the Santa Rosa Wall. And pretty much 
            wherever you dive, you're certain to see such exotic species as angelfish, nurse 
            sharks, sunfish, and sea turtles.</p>

        <h2>Cozumel Island Features</h2>
        <P>Measuring about 29 miles (46 km) from northeast to southwest and averaging 9 miles 
            (14 km) in width, it is the largest of Mexico’s inhabited islands. Geologically 
            similar to the Yucatán, the interior of Cozumel consists of a plain broken by low 
            hills that are only about 50 feet (15 metres) above sea level. Much of the island 
            is covered by scrubby tropical jungle. Poor soils have discouraged agriculture on 
            the island, but traditional crops include tropical fruits, henequen (a fibre crop), 
            corn (maize), and cassava (manioc).</P>
        <p>Clear, warm water, spectacular coral reefs, and abundant marine life make Cozumel 
            one of the world’s best scuba-diving destinations as well as a major resort. Indeed, 
            the economy of Cozumel has been based on tourism since the 1970s. In addition to 
            the diving opportunities, other water sports, and fishing, tourists are attracted 
            by Cozumel’s tropical climate, sand beaches, and duty-free port shopping, along 
            with its atmosphere, which is more relaxed than that of nearby Cancún. Substantial 
            resort development on the island’s protected western coast extends both north and 
            south from the island’s main town and commercial centre, San Miguel de Cozumel. 
            Chankanaab National Park, just south of San Miguel, has a museum, botanic garden, 
            and archaeological park. Cruise ships dock regularly at a pier south of San Miguel. 
            Cozumel has regular ferry service from Playa del Carmen and Puerto Morelos. An 
            international airport is located 2 miles (3 km) south of San Miguel.
