            <h3>Palancar Reef</h3>

            </picture>
            <p>Thanks to conservation efforts, marine life in the waters around Cozumel has bounced 
            back after decades of overfishing. Nowadays, the onus is on observing fish in their 
            natural habitat rather than catching them. The island is now extremely popular as a 
            destination for snorkelers and scuba divers, who are spoilt for choice when it comes 
            to choosing which lovely reef to explore.</p>
            <p>One of the best spots to dive is the Palancar Reef, rising from depths of up to 80 
            meters to shallows just beneath the surface of the sea at the southwest end of the 
            island. A popular dive includes a large bronze figure of Christ placed some 17 
            meters underwater. Other good diving locales are on the San Francisco, Paraíso, 
            Columbia, and Maracaibo reefs, as well as the Santa Rosa Wall. And pretty much 
            wherever you dive, you're certain to see such exotic species as angelfish, nurse 
            sharks, sunfish, and sea turtles.</p>

            <h3>Cozumel's Beaches</h3>

            </picture>
            <p>While the island is not particularly well known for its beaches, there are 
                beautiful areas of magnificent powdery white sand, a by-product of the numerous 
                coral reefs surrounding the island. Among the most popular and attractive of 
                Cozumel's beaches are Playa San Juan and Playa Santa Pilar in the northwest 
                corner of the island, and Playa San Francisco, Playa Santa Rosa, and Playa 
                Palancar to the southwest.</p>
            <p>Of note on the east side, which opens to the Caribbean Sea, are Playa Encantada, 
                Playa Hanan, Punta Morena, Playa Chen Río, and Playa Chiqueros. Also worth a 
                visit are Playa Mia Grand Beach Park, a popular spot for snorkeling due to its 
                easy access to the coral reefs at El Cielo.</p>

            <h3>Museum of the Island of Cozumel</h3>

            </picture>
            <p>In the heart of San Miguel de Cozumel, the excellent Museum of the Island of 
                Cozumel (Museo de la Isla de Cozumel) makes for a fun break from the beach. 
                The museum offers a great deal of information related to the history of the 
                island and its people, from its formation millions of years ago to its current 
                status as one of the Caribbean's most visited tourist destinations.</p>
            <p>In addition to its multi-media displays and permanent collections of ancient 
                artifacts, the museum also hosts numerous temporary exhibits, including 
                artwork from both international and local artists. Of particular interest is 
                the exhibit dealing with marine life, as well as a mock-up of the traditional 
                Mayan homes that were once common across the island (there's also an on-site 
                restaurant).</p>

            </picture>
            <p>Particularly popular among cruise ship passengers during their Cozumel stopover, 
                Discover Mexico Park Cozumel is one of the newest attractions on the island. In 
                addition to providing an interesting overview of Mexico's many diverse cultures, 
                highlights include miniature reconstructions of many of the country's most 
                important archaeological sites and historic attractions.</p>
            <p>Also of interest are the exhibits and multi-media shows showcasing traditional 
                music, art, and food—including a chance to sample locally made chocolate—along 
                with displays of traditional dances. A fascinating sight is the daring Danza de 
                los Voladores (Dance of the Flyers) involving participants throwing themselves 
                off a 30-meter-tall pole as they spin and twirl to the ground via ropes attached 
                to their feet.</p>
            <p>Address: Carretera Costera Sur Km 5.5, Zona Hotelera Nte., 77600 San Miguel de

            <h3>Cozumel's Mayan Heritage: San Gervasio</h3>

            </picture>
            <p>More than 30 Mayan sites have been found on Cozumel, some of them in beautiful 
                locations such as dense jungle or perched above pristine beaches. By far the 
                most important is that of San Gervasio, built in AD 800 and located 16 
                kilometers from San Miguel de Cozumel. Highlights of a visit include seeing 
                the Temple of Ix-chel, for centuries the focal point of the island's religious 
                life and a place of pilgrimage from across the Mayan empire.</p>
            <p>Also of interest are the nearby ruins at Santa Rita, while a little farther away 
                are the ruins of Santa Pilar and Castillo Real, the latter boasting Cozumel's 
                largest Mayan structure. There are also Mayan remains in the southeast corner 
                of the island at Buenavista and in the south at El Caracol.</p>

        <h2>Cozumel Island Features</h2>
        <P>Measuring about 29 miles (46 km) from northeast to southwest and averaging 9 miles 
            (14 km) in width, it is the largest of Mexico’s inhabited islands. Geologically 
            similar to the Yucatán, the interior of Cozumel consists of a plain broken by low 
            hills that are only about 50 feet (15 metres) above sea level. Much of the island 
            is covered by scrubby tropical jungle. Poor soils have discouraged agriculture on 
            the island, but traditional crops include tropical fruits, henequen (a fibre crop), 
            corn (maize), and cassava (manioc).</P>
        <p>Clear, warm water, spectacular coral reefs, and abundant marine life make Cozumel 
            one of the world’s best scuba-diving destinations as well as a major resort. Indeed, 
            the economy of Cozumel has been based on tourism since the 1970s. In addition to 
            the diving opportunities, other water sports, and fishing, tourists are attracted 
            by Cozumel’s tropical climate, sand beaches, and duty-free port shopping, along 
            with its atmosphere, which is more relaxed than that of nearby Cancún. Substantial 
            resort development on the island’s protected western coast extends both north and 
            south from the island’s main town and commercial centre, San Miguel de Cozumel. 
            Chankanaab National Park, just south of San Miguel, has a museum, botanic garden, 
            and archaeological park. Cruise ships dock regularly at a pier south of San Miguel. 
            Cozumel has regular ferry service from Playa del Carmen and Puerto Morelos. An 
            international airport is located 2 miles (3 km) south of San Miguel.
